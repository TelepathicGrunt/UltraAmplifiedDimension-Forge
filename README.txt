    Made for Minecraft v.1.14.4
    Created by TelepathicGrunt

Hello! If you are reading this, you must be on Github then! I strongly encourage you to only download and run the master branch as that should be the most stable version of my mod. 
If you try to use the latest Minecraft version branch, you may run into bugs and issues as I am experimenting and working on that latest version. Older version branches should be alright.

Highly recommend using a strong computer with this mod!
You can choose biome sizes, ore spawn rates, structure rarity, toggle biomes, and much more with this mod's config options!

Feel free to use this mod and any part of it for whatever you want as long as you do not profit off of my mod. 
Just be sure to have fun and make awesome mods! That's all. Enjoy! :)

       | Ultra Amplified mod changelog |
       
       
    (V.6.7 Changes) (1.14.4 Minecraft)
    
    Config: 
Added config option to trigger heavy fog in the Ultra Amplified Dimension for spooky effect. Set to false by default.
Added config options to control spawnrate of Sun Shrine and Stonehenge ministructures.
Fixed bug so that spawnrates config options now correctly apply for: Mineshafts, Caves, Ravines, Waterfalls, Lavafalls, Glowstone patches, Pillager Outposts, Ores, Sunshrines, Stonehenge, and End Islands.
Lowered maximum spawnrate option from 100 to 22 for Cave Caverns because anything 30 or above causes Minecraft to stop loading chunks due to how massive caverns are.
Lowered maximum spawnrate of End Islands from 500 to 100 because 500 is ridiculous lol. The entire land was pretty much all Endstone at that point with no opening or ledges.
Increased maximum range for glowstone variant patches.

	Dimension:
All light sources now look brighter and their light visually reaches further to make glow-variant patches look nicer. The actual light levels itself has not change.

    Biomes:
Added new cactus blocks to create better cactuses to spawn in desert biomes.
Desert Hills biome has less Sand under its surface which makes Stone appear more often on the bottom of ledges to make this biome slightly more distinct from regular Desert biome.
Foliage in End Barren Fields biome are now slightly more green. 
Added extra Iron Ores that spawn around sealevel for all biomes with "Mountain" in its name except for Ice Mountain biome.

    Blocks:
All blocks that this mod added is now available in the creative inventory.

            
    (V.6.6 Changes) (1.14.4 Minecraft)
    
    Dimension: 
路Futher improved portal mechanics so portal now remembers last position you were in Ultra Amplified Dimension when you last teleport out of it.
路The distance fog in the Ultra Amplified Dimension now becomes more dark the lower down in the world you go to help with immersion. Nothing breaks immersion like seeing a bright blue sky through an unloaded chunk when underground. Now it'll be dark blue!

       
    (V.6.5 Changes) (1.14.4 Minecraft)
    
    Dimension: 
路Patched bug that prevented the dimension from being registered and working on the latest forge build.
路Added floor around base of portal in the Ultra Amplified dimension.
路Improved portal mechanics so now the portal will teleport players to last dimension and position the player was at instead of always to the Overworld at world origin.

	Config:
路Added config option to let users select maximum height of terrain.
    
       
    (V.6.4 Changes) (1.14.4 Minecraft)
路Quick fix to patch bug that caused putting this mod into a server would make the server to crash.

       
    (V.6.3 Changes) (1.14.4 Minecraft)
       
    Major Changes:
路This mod is now its own dimension in any worldtype that isn't Ultra Amplified. To enter this dimension, make a portal with these blocks and then use Flint and Steel on Polished Diorite in center. Then right click on portal to enter.

PG = Polished Granite
BPAS = Bottom Polished Andesite Slab
TPAS = Top Polished Andesite Slab
PD =  Polished Diorite

    Bottom Layer:
PG   |  BPAS  |  PG
BPAS |  BPAS  |  BPAS
PG   |  BPAS  |  PG

    Middle Layer:
     |        |  
     |   PD   |  
     |        | 
  
     Top Layer:
PG   |  TPAS  |  PG
TPAS |  TPAS  |  TPAS
PG   |  TPAS  |  PG


Note: The Ultra Amplified Dimension will have a portal at 8, y, 8 always and is unabled to be removed in Survival. Any other portal can be removed by left clicking on it to turn it back into Polished Diorite.

     Config:
路Added option to modify the values used for the terrain perlin noise generator. Gives people the ability to make it more or less crazy.
    
     Biomes:
路Columns in Wooded Hills biomes now generates Dirt under its Grass Blocks correctly on the bottom half of the column.
路Fixed bug that prevent glowstone patches from fully generating.
路Greatly increased spawnrate of crosses in Swamp Hills biome.
     

    (V.6.2 Changes) (1.14.4 Minecraft)

     Terrain:
路Adjusted terrain so top layers islands are less frequent. Feedback on this change would be appreciated.

     Config:
路Made the M form config now correctly make an actual area M form instead of tiny chunk size patches of the M biomes.
路Config values for if Plains, Savanna, and Wooded Mountains biomes should generate now correctly applies when these biomes tries to generate as a border separation between certain biomes.
路Stronghold config values changed to reflect the new way Strongholds generate and the config values now applies correctly.

     Biomes:
路Snowy Beach biome now spawns less often on land and will now also spawn along edges of where snowy biomes meets oceans.
路Stone Beach biome now spawns less often on land and will now also spawn along edges of where Extreme Hills biomes meets oceans.
路Mushroom Biomes will no longer spawn in ocean biomes but will continue to generate on land like it has before. This is because the ocean biomes looks better when it is mainly ocean and not interrupted by the Mushroom biome.
路Glowstone variant patches are more tighter.
路Added roots and short vines that spawn on the under-side of floating land in Forest, Birch Forest, Dark Forest, Giant Tree Taiga, Wooded Badlands Plateau, Savanna, Shattered Savanna, Snowy Taiga, Swamp, Taiga and all their hills and M variants biomes. The hills variants has denser roots.

     Structures:
路Strongholds now generate like other structures instead of being limited to a certain number per world so it is easier to find Strongholds.
路Fixed bug that prevented Ender Eyes from pointing to closest Stronghold.
路Locate command now works and will find all main structures. (Cannot find Stonehenge or Sun Shrine)


    (V.6.1 Changes) (1.14.4 Minecraft)

     Config:
路Added config option for Pillager Outposts.
路Lava ocean config option now applies to Ocean biomes.
路Changed how M biome config option now affects the spawnrate of M variant biomes. It should be more uniform and consistent now and should work better

路Patched bug that prevented most Wooded Badlands Plateau biome from spawning when config is set to only Badlands biomes for generation.
路Added config option to turn on and off column/ramp generation.
路Combined the structure generation and spawnrate config options into one to reduce number of configs. Set the structure spawnrate to 101 to turn off generation for that structure.
路Added config option to affect the spawnrates of glowstone variant patches

     Biomes:
路Added Bamboo Jungle biome to generate in this mod along with some modification. Uses real Bamboo unlike the Sugar Cane that the 1.12 version of this mod used!
路Adjusted grass density in Jungle biomes so the grond isn't 100% covered in grass.
路Fixed Jungle Bushes in Jungle biome to generate under ledges now.
路M forms of Redwood Taiga biomes now generates slightly less trees to be less dense.
路Fixed bug preventing Mesa Plateau variant biomes from spawning.
路Patched bug that made Deep variants of oceans super rare when config biome options is set to oceans only. 
路Added Coarse Dirt, Clay, and Gravel patches to spawn at bottom of water in all biomes (except oceans, Nether, and End biomes. Desert biomes gets Sandstone, Sand, and Clay patches). These patches can be easily found between sea level and Y = 40 in all biomes or in the shallow lakes in Swamp, Desert lakes, Modified Jungle, Modified Jungle Hills, and Bamboo Jungle Hills biomes.
路Warm and Lukewarm Ocean biomes now has a sandy bottom below sea level and neutral Ocean biomes has Gravel bottom below sea level. 
路Badlands biome now generates Red Sand at all heights above sea level to better distinguish it from Badlands Plateau biome.
路Modified Badlands Plateau biome and Modified Wooded Badlands Plateau biome generates Deadbush, lavafalls, and Gold Ore more often with the wooden biome generating more trees as well.
路The End biome has been changed so that terrain above Y = 70 generates Grass Blocks, Dirt, and Stone like most other biomes. Reduced spawnrate of Chorus Plant. Generates patches of Endstone, Endstone Bricks, and Obsidian. Spawns Berry Bushes, small amount of Tallgrass/Ferns, and a hybrid tree with Birch Trunk, Dark Oak Leaves, and a patch of Blue Terracotta at base of trunk.
路Added Barren End Field biome to make a thin border around the End biome for better biome transition. This biome is slightly less purple than the End biome, has a small amount of patches of Obsidian and Endstone, no trees, and can spawn Berry Bushes.
路Nether biome now has a thin Savanna border for better biome transition.
路All biomes has patches of mainly Glowstone Ore blocks (and sometimes other Glowstone variants) between Y = 45 to 70 (some has Y = 60 as max) to provide light at top of the topmost Ravine maze and at top of Cave Caverns. 
路Most biomes now has patches of Glowstone variant blocks under their ledges to provide light (spawns at Y = 70 and higher). The biomes that does not have these patches includes all snowy biomes, all ocean biomes, and most Badlands biomes.
路Patched bug that made Tall Birch Forest trees leaves break because the leaves were too far from the trunk. 
路Patched bug that generated giant trees too close to build height limit and got them cut off in Dark Forest Hills biome.

     Structures:
路Crosses with very rare hidden chest in Swampland Hills biome has their loot nerfed.
路End Cities lowered by 8 blocks so they do not get cut off by height limit.
路Nether Fortresses that spawns underground in all biomes now generates as a stone variant. Aboveground Nether Fortresses in the Nether remains the same.
路Added Pillager Outposts to Plains, Snowy Taiga, Taiga, Dark Forest, Tundra, Savanna, Shattered Savanna, and Desert biomes.
路Made Marked Treasure Chests 2.5 times more common due to difficulty finding the Red Sand 'X' below sea level.
路Mineshaft blocks has been changed for most Mineshaft types to add variety and look better.
路Water filled caves has been added to all ocean biomes. You may find entrances to these new caves in Ravines, Cave Cavities, or on the ocean floor!
路Added pool in front of Ocean Monument entrance so it is easier to get inside as before, the small entrance could be easily blocked by terrain.
路Fixed Ocean Monument bug preventing entrances to the Elder Guardian rooms from being made.
路Fixed Ocean Monument bug that let terrain blocks be generated in the Monument. Coral and Icebergs can rarely still be generated inside.
路Ocean Monument can be at a random height between Y = 67 and Y = 85 as they were at a fixed height at Y = 67 before to minimize the occurrence of the terrain block bug.
路Added columns and ramps to most biomes to give a more cave-like appearance as well as make travel between layers of land easier. All ocean biomes does not have columns/ramps. 
路Jungle Temple chest loot has been significantly buffed and the Dispensers now shoot Arrows with long poison effect.

     Blocks:
路Coarse Glowdirt, Glowdirt, Glowgrass Block, Glowmycelium, Glowpodzol, Glowsand, Glowstone Ore, and Red Glowsand has been added. The blocks will give off light and when mined, will drop Glowstone dust and the base block. Fortune and Silk Touch works on these blocks.
     
      
    (V.5.0 Changes) (1.13.2 Minecraft)
       
     Major Changes:
路Mod updated from 1.12.2 to work on 1.13.2 now!

     Config:
路The Config GUI no longer works as 1.13 Forge does not have a working config UI. Instead, exit the Minecraft world you are in, look for the serverconfig folder in the save folder for that specific world, and edit the ultra_amplified_mod-server.toml file to change the config. Then enter the Minecraft world or restart server for the changes to take place. To make a fresh new world with a different config, create a new world and force close Minecraft before it starts showing the generation percentage. Then change the config and re-enter the world.
路Added config options for the new ocean biomes and ocean structures.
路Seperated scattered structures config to now let players control generation of every kind of scattered structure separately.
路Now can control whether Nether Fortresses can generate aboveground or underground or both.

路All Ocean biomes can spawn a new kind of Treasure Chest that is marked with an 'X' made of Red Sand at Y = 52! I call this feature... Marked Treasure Chest! (Original I know lol)
路Most biomes now generate extra Gold, Redstone, and Lapis in a small range around 5 and 15 blocks below sea level to make underwater diving more rewarding.

路Ice Mountain biome now has lakes made of Ice and Blue Ice.
路Ice Mountain biome now can generate waterfalls made of Blue Ice.
路Ice Spike biome now has a layer of Ice with Water below it at sea level instead of Snow Blocks.

路All Jungle biomes no longer spawn Ocean Monuments.
路Nether biome will generate a border of Savanna biome if it touches a Snowy Tundra or Snowy Taiga biome.

路Tall Birch Forest Hills biome now generates more giant Birch Trees to make it more dense.
路Desert Biomes, Snowy Beach biome, and Gravely Mountain biomes now have blocks that cannot fall under their Sand/Gravel to help reduce the insane nearly-unplayable lag that occurs when ledges of Sand/Gravel begins falling.
路Removed Bamboo Forest due to Bamboo Jungle being added in vanilla 1.14 and that this biome caused a great deal of lag from all the Sugar Cane.
       
       Structures:
路Hay Bales in M forms of Jungles are now more common.
路Dungeons now have a new appearance for what biome they are in. (Forms include normal, mesa, desert, snow, nether, end, dark forest, mushroom, and swamp)
路Dungeon now have less strict requirements on where they can generate and so spawnrates and density bands have been re-adjusted to account for more successful generations.
路Mineshafts now takes on the Swamp variant when in Dark Forest biome and Ocean variant when in any Ocean biome.
路Mineshafts now place their supports/archs even when the hallway is not in the ground.
路Fossils now generates on the surface of a ledge that does not have direct sunlight (before it could spawn floating in midair).

路Ocean Monuments now continually spawn Guardians over time which makes a Guardian farm now possible.
路Adjusted what kind of blocks spawn in Villages.
路Ravines are now split between two levels. The first kind of Ravine spawn higher at a high rate to make a maze. The second kind of Ravine spawns around lava level and are extremely long. Both kinds of ravines are much shorter than the Ravines in 1.12 version of this mod.
路Cave Cavities have been redone. They now spawn giant areas with ledges along the edges with stalagmites in the ceiling. Giant pillars will also spawn that flattens out towards the bottom to provide a path for the player to walk across past the lava floor of the cave.

    (V.1 Changes) (1.12 Minecraft)

    Terrain:
路Made world terrain far more amplified than what amplified world type normally makes. The terrain is a mixture of being layered, full of overhangs, and having loads of floating islands.
路Change caves to be supermassive open areas to create giant underground caverns that are filled with lava at the bottom.
路Increased Ravine spawn rate significantly to insane values as well as limit their height to just be barely above lava at y = 10. This creates a massive maze-like network underground. 
路Made all ores and stone patches (such as granite) spawn higher to compensate for the amplified terrain.
路Made Lapis Ore, Coal Ore, Redstone Ore, and Iron Ore slightly more common. 

    Biomes:
路Made all Biomes generate much smaller to help player not have to travel as far to reach a new Biome.
路Replaced Ocean Biome with Ice Spike Biome.
路Replaced Deep Ocean Biome with Mesa Bryce Biome.
路Added Mushroom Biome to cold biome and neutral Biome generation list so it spawns inland in cold and neutral biome areas.
路Increased spawn rate of small and large mushrooms in Mushroom Biome.
路Gave all Birch Forests super tall Birch Trees that are larger than normal Birch Forest M Trees.
路Made Ice Spikes have a bigger chance of generating extra tall Ice Spikes as well and making those spike's heights much taller.
路Ice Spike's Spikes now will continue to generate downward to the first non-air block below y = 50.  
路Made Spikes in Mesa Bryce much thicker and extremely tall to around max world height.
路Added Silverfish Stone Blocks to Mesa Bryce Biomes but made their spawn rate very low.
路Increased height that Silverfish Stone Blocks spawn in Extreme Hills Biomes and also increased their spawn rate there to keep the density of Silverfish Blocks in that Biome the same.
路Made 2 by 2 trees in Jungle Biomes much taller.
路Made 2 by 2 trees in Mega Taiga Biomes much taller and made their leaves bigger to compensate.
路Changed boulders in Mega Taiga Biomes to be much larger and changed the boulder's block composition to these blocks from most common to least common: Mossy Cobblestone, Cobblestone, Andersite, Coal Ore, Iron Ore, and Diamond Ore.
路Changed Mega Taiga Biomes' and Extreme Hills M Biomes' temperatures to make it so they do not get snow at any height.
路Changed Taiga Biomes' temperature so that they get snow only when higher than y = 234.
路Made Swamp Biomes alternate between land and water when in clear view of the sky for heights between 80 and 200 to create a cool visual effect.
路Increased spawn rates for Sugar Cane in Swamp Biomes.
路Increased spawn rate of Clay in Swamp Biomes. (Can be found quickly by digging around water)
路Added Hell Biome (Nether) as a possible Biome for neutral temperature Biome areas. This Biome is characterized by having no trees or tall grass. All Grass blocks looks dead. Pigmens should spawn in large numbers in this Biome.

    Structures:
路Created Slime Lakes that spawn commonly below y = 175 to help facilitate jumping off cliffs safely.

路Increased Spawn rare of Desert Temples, Jungle Temples, Witch Huts, and Igloos as well as allow all of them to fuse to themselves.

路Worked really hard to get the water and rooms to spawn correctly and at the Ocean Monument's correct height.
路Made Woodland Mansions be able to spawn in Jungles Biomes and Plains Biomes as well as Increased it's spawn rate and allow for Woodland Mansions to fuse to themselves.
路Increased spawn rate of Fossil and added Savanna Biomes as a possible Biome for Fossils to spawn in. (Previously couldn't spawn in Savanna in Java Edition)
路Increased Dungeon spawn rates across the board but significantly jack up their spawn rates to extreme values for heights higher than y = 150.
路Decreased Mineshaft spawn rates slightly.
路Increased the max height at which Mineshafts can spawn. 
路Mineshafts that spawn above around y = 130 will generate normally. Any Mineshaft below that will have their Dirt Room stretched up beyond a hundred blocks to create a super deep pit in the world. In addition, these Mineshafts will have their three layers of paths separated and generally generate at bottom, middle, and top of this pit/vertically stretched Dirt Room.
路All Mineshaft Dirt Rooms now can generate even when their location is filled with liquid or air. 
路The radius of the Dirt Rooms in Mineshafts below Y = 130 is increased by 10 blocks to create 20 block wide pits in the world.
