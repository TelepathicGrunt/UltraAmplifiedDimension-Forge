    Made for Minecraft v.1.15.1
    Created by TelepathicGrunt

Hello! If you are reading this, you must be on Github then! I strongly encourage you to only download and run the master branch as that should be the most stable version of my mod. 
If you try to use the latest Minecraft version branch, you may run into bugs and issues as I am experimenting and working on that latest version. Older version branches should be alright.

Highly recommend using a strong computer with this mod!
You can choose biome sizes, ore spawn rates, structure rarity, toggle biomes, and much more with this mod's config options!

Feel free to use this mod and any part of it for whatever you want as long as you do not profit off of my mod. 
Just be sure to have fun and make awesome mods! That's all. Enjoy! :)

    Major Change: 
·Ported to 1.15.1! Celebration time!
·This mod is now renamed from Ultra Amplified Mod to Ultra Amplified Dimension !
 
	Config: 
·Lowered the default maximum Y value for terrain gen to 245 from 248. This is to help prevent floating flat lands with no trees because it is too high for tree to spawn.
·Added config for Honey Lakes.

    Structures:

·Netherland biome now has more Fire below Y = 100.
·Fixed bug where the Magma block layer below sealevel in Netherland was not creating bubble columns.

·Slightly increased lavafall rates in Stone Plains biome.
·Slightly increased waterfall rates in End Field biome.
·Adjusted tree generation in all Jungles to fix some ground trees not spawning underground.
·Spiky Badlands' giant spikes are spiker, more common, and all spikes now will go through water at sealevel instead of being cut off.

·If players now right click the Amplified Portal Block while crouching, they can place blocks on the portal instead of teleporting.
·Changed texture of Amplified Portal Block to be opaque and adjusted the texture itself to fit being opaque. This is to stop the bug of clouds appearing through the block when it was translucent.

·Fixed bug where snow would not generate under ledges in icey biomes bordering an Ice Mountain biome.
·Fixed bug where ocean biomes may generate weird glitchy looking terrain that alternates between air and water each block height below sealevel. It's hard to explain but if you haven't noticed it before, well, you certainly won't see this bug in the future!

    Structures: 
·Mineshafts in Nether biome will now place 2 Redstone Torches with Redstone wire in between at the top of arches that has a Redstone Lamp.
·Ocean Monuments will now remove solid blocks if it blocks off the entrance to make it much more unlikely that the entrance is completely sealed off by terrain.

    Dimension
·The portal frame made in Ultra Amplified Dimension will have waterlogged Andesite Slabs if the slabs replaces water.

·Lowered maximum spawnrate option from 100 to 22 for Cave Caverns because anything 30 or above causes Minecraft to stop loading chunks due to how massive caverns are.
·Lowered maximum spawnrate of End Islands from 500 to 100 because 500 is ridiculous lol. The entire land was pretty much all Endstone at that point with no opening or ledges.
·Increased maximum range for glowstone variant patches.

	Dimension:
·All light sources now look brighter and their light visually reaches further to make glow-variant patches look nicer. The actual light levels itself has not change.

    Dimension: 
·Futher improved portal mechanics so portal now remembers last position you were in Ultra Amplified Dimension when you last teleport out of it.
·The distance fog in the Ultra Amplified Dimension now becomes more dark the lower down in the world you go to help with immersion. Nothing breaks immersion like seeing a bright blue sky through an unloaded chunk when underground. Now it'll be dark blue!
·Clouds now generate higher (2 higher than what the yMaximum value is set for the terrain in the config option)

       
    (V.6.5 Changes) (1.14.4 Minecraft)
    
    Dimension: 
·Patched bug that prevented the dimension from being registered and working on the latest forge build.

    (V.6.3 Changes) (1.14.4 Minecraft)
       
    Major Changes:
·This mod is now its own dimension in any worldtype that isn't Ultra Amplified. To enter this dimension, make a portal with these blocks and then use Flint and Steel on Polished Diorite in center. Then right click on portal to enter.

PG = Polished Granite
BPAS = Bottom Polished Andesite Slab

TPAS |  TPAS  |  TPAS
PG   |  TPAS  |  PG


Note: The Ultra Amplified Dimension will have a portal at 8, y, 8 always and is unabled to be removed in Survival. Any other portal can be removed by left clicking on it to turn it back into Polished Diorite.

     Config:
·Added option to modify the values used for the terrain perlin noise generator. Gives people the ability to make it more or less crazy.

·Nether biome now has a thin Savanna border for better biome transition.
·All biomes has patches of mainly Glowstone Ore blocks (and sometimes other Glowstone variants) between Y = 45 to 70 (some has Y = 60 as max) to provide light at top of the topmost Ravine maze and at top of Cave Caverns. 
·Most biomes now has patches of Glowstone variant blocks under their ledges to provide light (spawns at Y = 70 and higher). The biomes that does not have these patches includes all snowy biomes, all ocean biomes, and most Badlands biomes.
·Patched bug that made Tall Birch Forest trees leaves break because the leaves were too far from the trunk. 
·Patched bug that generated giant trees too close to build height limit and got them cut off in Dark Forest Hills biome.

     Structures:
·Crosses with very rare hidden chest in Swampland Hills biome has their loot nerfed.

·Fixed Ocean Monument bug preventing entrances to the Elder Guardian rooms from being made.
·Fixed Ocean Monument bug that let terrain blocks be generated in the Monument. Coral and Icebergs can rarely still be generated inside.
·Ocean Monument can be at a random height between Y = 67 and Y = 85 as they were at a fixed height at Y = 67 before to minimize the occurrence of the terrain block bug.
·Added columns and ramps to most biomes to give a more cave-like appearance as well as make travel between layers of land easier. All ocean biomes does not have columns/ramps. 
·Jungle Temple chest loot has been significantly buffed and the Dispensers now shoot Arrows with long poison effect.

     Blocks:
·Coarse Glowdirt, Glowdirt, Glowgrass Block, Glowmycelium, Glowpodzol, Glowsand, Glowstone Ore, and Red Glowsand has been added. The blocks will give off light and when mined, will drop Glowstone dust and the base block. Fortune and Silk Touch works on these blocks.

     Major Changes:
·Mod updated from 1.12.2 to work on 1.13.2 now!

     Config:
·The Config GUI no longer works as 1.13 Forge does not have a working config UI. Instead, exit the Minecraft world you are in, look for the serverconfig folder in the save folder for that specific world, and edit the ultra_amplified_mod-server.toml file to change the config. Then enter the Minecraft world or restart server for the changes to take place. To make a fresh new world with a different config, create a new world and force close Minecraft before it starts showing the generation percentage. Then change the config and re-enter the world.
