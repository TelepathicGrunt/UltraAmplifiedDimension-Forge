Highly recommend to also use the Optifine mod with my mod as well!
You can choose biome sizes, ore spawn rates, structure rarity, selection biomes, and much more with this mod's config options!

Feel free to use this mod and any part of it for whatever you want as long as you do not profit off of my mod. 
Just be sure to give me credit if you do take parts of my mod. That's all. Enjoy! :)

       | Ultra Amplified mod changelog |
       
       
    (V.5.0 Changes) (1.13 Minecraft)
       
     Major Changes:
·Mod updated from 1.12.2 to work on 1.13.2 now!

     Config:
·The Config GUI no longer works as 1.13 Forge does not have a working config UI. Instead, exit the Minecraft world you are in, look for the serverconfig folder in the save folder for that specific world, and edit the ultra_amplified_mod-server.toml file to change the config. Then enter the Minecraft world or restart server for the changes to take place. To make a fresh new world with a different config, create a new world and force close Minecraft before it starts showing the generation percentage. Then change the config and re-enter the world.
·Added config options for the new ocean biomes and ocean structures.
·Seperated scattered structures config to now let players control generation of every kind of scattered structure separately.
·Now can control whether Nether Fortresses can generate aboveground or underground or both.
·Renamed biome config names to match the new biome names in 1.13.

     Biomes:
·Added Ultra Amplified versions of all Oceans! Deep Oceans has Shipwrecks and Ocean Monuments while shallow Oceans has Ruins, Treasure Chests, and Ocean Monuments!
·All Ocean biomes can spawn a new kind of Treasure Chest that is marked with an 'X' made of Red Sand at Y = 52! I call this feature... Marked Treasure Chest! (Original I know lol)
·Most biomes now generate extra Gold, Redstone, and Lapis in a small range around 5 and 15 blocks below sea level to make underwater diving more rewarding.
·Many changes was made to how features (plants, snow, etc) so they spawn more efficiently and cleaner on all ledges.
·Ice Mountain biome now has lakes made of Ice and Blue Ice.
·Ice mountain biome now can generate waterfalls made of Blue Ice.
·Ice Spike biome now has a layer of Ice with Water below it at sea level instead of Snow Blocks.
·Nether biome now spawns regions of Gravel and Soul Sand that is different at each height (before it was based on x and z positions).
·Nether biome now generates a layer of Magma Blocks several blocks below sea level Water and then generates Lava below the Magma Blocks.
·Nether biome now generates Quartz Ore less frequently above Y = 120.
·End biome now generates End Islands less frequently at higher heights.
·End biome now generates Shulker Boxes and Dragon Heads below sea level at a low chance and can spawn a Dragon Egg at any height but is extremely rare.
·Desert M biome now generates large areas of water to better fit its new 1.13 name which is Desert Lake biome.
·M forms of Redwood Taiga biomes now generates tiny boulders and their pillars are now shorter but thicker.
·Jungle Edge biomes now generates when a jungle touches the Badlands biome or Savanna biome in addition to the Swamp biome that it used to do.
·Biomes that does not use Stone for their main block now generates their block true to their biome edge (before, if you were underground, you would see the Nether's Netherrack spawning by chunks instead of following the Nether's biome edge cleanly)
·All Jungle biomes no longer spawn Ocean Monuments.
·Savanna Plateau and Shattered Savanna Plateau now generates giant pillars under its dirt terrain!
·Tall Birch Forest Hills biome now generates more giant Birch Trees to make it more dense.
·Desert Biomes and Gravely Mountain biomes now have blocks that cannot fall under their Sand/Gravel to help reduce the insane nearly-unplayable lag that occurs when ledges of Sand/Gravel begins falling.
·Removed Bamboo Forest due to Bamboo Jungle being added in vanilla 1.14 and that this biome caused a great deal of lag from all the Sugar Cane.
       
       Structures:
·Hay Bales in M forms of Jungles are now more common.
·Dungeons now have a new appearance for what biome they are in. (Forms include normal, mesa, desert, snow, nether, end, dark forest, mushroom, and swamp)
·Dungeon now have less strict requirements on where they can generate and so spawnrates and density bands have been re-adjusted to account for more successful generations.
·Mineshafts now takes on the Swamp variant when in Dark Forest biome and Ocean variant when in any Ocean biome.
·Mineshafts now place their supports/archs even when the hallway is not in the ground.
·Fossils now generates on the surface of a ledge that does not have direct sunlight (before it could spawn floating in midair).
·End Cities now generates much, much bigger (three full branches instead of one).
·Desert Temples now have more TNT and is more dangerous to make safe. Be very careful!
·Jungle Temples now have more hidden chests, more Dispensers that shoot arrows, and some Cobblestone is infested with Silverfish.
·Witch Huts now generate 2 Witches at start instead of 1.
·Woodland Mansions cannot spawn in Plains biome or mutated Birch Forest biomes now.
·Igloos can now also spawn in Ice Mountain biome and all Snowy Taiga biomes.
·Fixed Ocean Monuments so all rooms can be accessed now without resorting to TNT to break walls.
·Adjusted what kind of blocks spawn in Villages.
·Ravines are now split between two levels. The first kind of Ravine spawn higher at a high rate to make a maze. The second kind of Ravine spawns around lava level and are extremely long. Both kinds of ravines are much shorter than the Ravines in 1.12 version of this mod.
·Cave Cavities have been redone. They now spawn giant areas with ledges along the edges with stalagmites in the ceiling. Giant pillars will also spawn that flattens out towards the bottom to provide a path for the player to walk across past the lava floor of the cave.
·Icy Village now generates in Snowy Beach and Snowy Tundra biomes as well.

·Added a rare small Stonehenge to generate in any biome with "Hills" in its name (Except for Extreme Hills Biomes) and has a very small chance of generating an Enchanting Table.
·Villages in Stone Beach Biome generates Stone instead of Dirt so the bottom of Farmlands blend better with the biome.
·For Mesa and Desert biomes, replaced the 1% Dungeon chance of Giant Zombie Spawners with Illusioner Spawners as Giant Zombies cannot spawn through Mob Spawners.
·The bug that caused Ocean Monument to not spawn at correct heights is squashed. Now they generate between the height Y = 97 and Y = 242 regardless of what the terrain height is.
