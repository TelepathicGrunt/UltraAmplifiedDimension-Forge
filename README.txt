Highly recommend to also use the Optifine mod with my mod as well!
You can choose biome sizes, ore spawn rates, structure rarity, selection biomes, and much more with this mod's config options!

Feel free to use this mod and any part of it for whatever you want as long as you do not profit off of my mod. 
Just be sure to give me credit if you do take parts of my mod. That's all. Enjoy! :)

       | Ultra Amplified mod changelog |
       
       
    (V.4.6.1 Changes)
       
     Block:
·Amplified Portal Block's flame particles now show up correctly.     
     
     Misc:
·Fixed weird bug where teleporting between any dimensions will crash the game. In order to fix this bug, I had to remove the percentage that shows how much of the world was created when creating a new world.


    (V.4.6.0 Changes)
    
    Major changes:
·Backported Ultra Amplified dimension from 1.14. This includes the portal block and frame. To create the portal, use Smooth Stone Slab in place of the Polished Andersite Slab since 1.12 does not have Polished Andersite Slabs. Have fun! 
       
       
    (V.4.4 Changes)
    
     Config:
·Added super secret setting that does something! (Can't say what lol. Try it!)
·Fixed some config namings.
·Added config option to turn on and off mini-structures such as Crosses, Hay Bale, Fossils, Sun Shrine, Stonehenges, and Desert Wells.
·Made lower config values now spawn more Villages, Temples, Nether Fortresses, End Cities, Ocean Monuemnts, and Woodland Mansions but raised default value to keep same default spawnrates.
    
     Biomes:
·Biome distribution is now much better when fewer biomes are selected in the config settings.
·Fixed bug where Desert M Biome spawned instead of Desert Hills Biome.
·Bamboo Forest now spawns Llamas, Parrots, Pigs, Chickens, and Bats instead of default passive mobs.
·Increased Pumpkin spawn rate due to difficulty in finding them with current terrain.
·Fixed Chorus Plant's spawn placement so they are less clustered. (Probably not noticable)
·Fixed bug where End Islands could spawn low enough to replace Bedrock at Y = 0 with End Stone.
·Increased Slime spawnrate in Swampland M Biome.

    Structures:
·Added a very rare Sun Shrine to generate in any biome with "Hills" in its name. (Except for Extreme Hills Biomes)
·Added a rare small Stonehenge to generate in any biome with "Hills" in its name (Except for Extreme Hills Biomes) and has a very small chance of generating an Enchanting Table.
·Villages in Stone Beach Biome generates Stone instead of Dirt so the bottom of Farmlands blend better with the biome.
·For Mesa and Desert biomes, replaced the 1% Dungeon chance of Giant Zombie Spawners with Illusioner Spawners as Giant Zombies cannot spawn through Mob Spawners.
·The bug that caused Ocean Monument to not spawn at correct heights is squashed. Now they generate between the height Y = 97 and Y = 242 regardless of what the terrain height is.
·Witch Huts' Brewing Stand now can have up three potions which can be Potion of Leaping, Potion of Poison, and Potion of Night Vision with the last potion being the rarest.

     Misc:
·Updated info that shows under this mod's World Type to be more accurate.
  
  

    (V.4.3 Changes)
    
    Config:

·Decreased minimum possible spawn height for Sea Level option from 65 to 0.

·Added option to control Magma spawnrate below Y = 100 in Nether Biome.
·Added option to control single Lava Block spawnrate in Nether Biome.
·Changed Silverfish Block Spawnrate option for Extreme Hills Biome and Stronghold into two seperate options.
    
    Biomes:
·Made Plains, Forest, and Ice Mountain unable to spawn through the GenLayer for hills if those biomes are disabled.(example: Roofed Forests Biomes may generate Plains Biomes in them which is unwanted if player has the option for Plains disabled.)
·Lava Ocean will spawn instead of Snow Blocks in Ice Mountain and Ice Spike Biome when the Lava Ocean config option is turned on.
·Decreased Lava spawn rate in Nether to cut down a bit on the excessive amount of Lavafalls. 
·Slightly adjusted Magma and Quartz spawnrates in Nether Biome.
