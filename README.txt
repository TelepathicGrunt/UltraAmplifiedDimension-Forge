Copy the .jar into forge's mod folder and enjoy! Highly recommend to also use the Optifine mod as well!
You can choose between normal and large biomes by selecting the Ultra Amplfied or Ultra Amplfied LB world types.

Feel free to use this mod for whatever you want as long as you do not make money or profit off of it. 
If you do, you better share some of that cash with me! LOL. 
Just kidding! Mojang probably won't be happy so please don't profit off my mod or pretend you made it.
